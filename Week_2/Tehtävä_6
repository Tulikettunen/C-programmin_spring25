Ex6
Write a program that prints a menu and asks user to select an operation. The operations are:
• Roll D6
• Roll D10
• Quit
Input must be validated and a descriptive error message must be printed if input is invalid. Rolling
D6 prints a random number in the range of 1 – 6 and rolling D10 prints a random number in the
range of 1 – 10. If user does not select quit the program prints the menu again.
Use functions to structure your program.
See: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/random/rand for how to produce random numbers
in a range.
