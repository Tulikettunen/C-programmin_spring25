Airline seat manager

Write a program for managing seats in an airplane. The airplane has 26 rows with six seats on each
row. The seats are marked with letters A to F so that:
    • A and F are by window
    • C and D are by the aisle
    • B and E are in the middle

The program stores seat reservations in a CSV-file where each row contains information about one
seat:
    • First name
    • Last name
    • Row number
    • Seat (A-F)

The program must have at least the following functionality:
    • Reserve a seat:
        o Enter name of the passenger, row and seat
        o Print error message if seat is already taken
        o Add the reservation to the end of the file
    • Print the seat map of the airplane
        o On the left the row number
        o All seats so that aisle is printed as three spaces
        o Free seats are printed with an uppercase letter
        o Reserved seats are printed with a lower-case letter ‘x’.

        For example:
            1 ABx DEF
            2 ABC DEF
            3 xxC xxF

    • Print a list of passengers sorted by last name and first name
